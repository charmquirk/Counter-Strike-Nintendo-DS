# CharmQuirk's Fork of Counter Strike NDS
I'm editing the code on my own. I am unable to build and test the code right now. There are no releases of this fork available yet. Contact me if you have any questions. Checkout the original/main branch [here](https://github.com/Fewnity/Counter-Strike-Nintendo-DS).

# CharmQuirk's TODO
I have a few changes I would like to make with my fork of this game:

### Miscellaneous Improvements
- [ ] General code cleanup. **Ongoing**
- [ ] Optimize network code. **Started**

### Improve input handling
- [ ] Normalizing movement vectors, preventing moving faster horizontally. **Testing Needed**
- [ ] Move all movement code to the movement script. Take it OUT of the main script aka the main game loop. **Partially Complete**
- [ ] Add "double tap touch screen to jump" from Metroid Prime: Hunters DS (as requested).
- [ ] Add better input customization and re-add old control scheme.
- [ ] Add touch input aim acceleration curve.

- [ ] Put defuse/plant bomb ui button on touch screen.
- [ ] Temporarily remove Jump ui button from the touch screen. 
- [ ] Reorganize settings menu and add tabs.
