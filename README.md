# CharmQuirk's TODO
I have a few changes I would like to make with my fork of this game:

![Bottom Screen UI Concept Image](https://github.com/charmquirk/Counter-Strike-Nintendo-DS/blob/main/.external/UI%20Concepts/UI%20Concepts%20-%20Bottom%20Screen.png)

### Improve UI
- [ ] Add screen with a button to skip tutorial.
- [ ] Put defuse bomb button on touch screen.
- [ ] Temporarily remove Jump ui button from the touch screen. 
- [ ] Reorganize settings menu and add tabs.
- [ ] Reorganize the bottom screen. Put camo matching team color on bottom screen

### Improve input handling
- [ ] Move all movement code to the movement script. Take it OUT of the main script aka the main game loop.
- [ ] Add "double tap touch screen to jump" from Metroid Prime: Hunters DS (as requested).
- [ ] Add customizable inputs and re-add old control scheme.
- [ ] Add touch input aim acceleration curve.
- [ ] Normalizing movement vectors, preventing moving faster horizontally.
