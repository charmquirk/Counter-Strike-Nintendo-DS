# CharmQuirk's TODO
I have a few changes I would like to make with my fork of this game:

Improve UI
[ ] Add screen with a button to skip tutorial.
[ ] Put defuse bomb button on touch screen.
[ ] Temporarily remove Jump ui button from the touch screen. 
[ ] Reorganize settings menu and add tabs.
[ ] Reorganize the bottom screen. Put camo matching team color on bottom screen

Improve input handling
[ ] Move all movement code to the movement script. Take it OUT of the main script aka the main game loop.
[ ] Add "double tap touch screen to jump" from Metroid Prime: Hunters DS (as requested).
[ ] Add customizable inputs and re-add old control scheme.
[ ] Add touch input aim acceleration curve.
[ ] Normalizing movement vectors, preventing moving faster horizontally.
